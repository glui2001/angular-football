Programming exercise in angular using public web service API

Web candidate take home programming assignment

Using the public api found at http://api.football-data.org/index, create a WORKING AngularJS web application that does the following:

1. Shows a list of all competitions based on a user inputed season.
2. Selecting a competition shows all the teams for that competition on a DIFFERENT page
3. Selecting a team shows ANOTHER page with team information and a list of all players on that team
4. Allow the ability to navigate to previous pages and select another value.

Iâ€™ll leave it to you how you define, create, and structure the UI.  The only requirement is that it is intuitive and elegant.

Bonus points: Make it responsive.
